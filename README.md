This is a SHINY app developed for ESM 244: Advanced Data Analysis at the Bren School of Environmental Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the winter 2022 quarter. This application works with data from https://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/map/pfas_map and visualized influent and effluent concentration of PFAS in California Wastewater Treatment Plants. 

There are four sections of the application.

**Tab 1:** Background on PFAS and interactive data table showing all of observed PFAS in the site.

**Tab 2:** Leaflet map of all of the selected wastewater treatment plants of the study. Operational flow rate is included when the site is clicked on.

**Tab 3:** Visualization of the influent and effluent PFAS concentrations in ng/L (ppb) for each site and sample date.

**Tab 4:** Visualization of the effluent concentrations that have at least a 2 ng/L increase in concentration compared to the influent concentrations by site and sample data - prompting  a question of the formation and conversion of PFAS into other types of PFAS in wastewater treatment plants.
