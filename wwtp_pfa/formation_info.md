A major finding in the analysis of the PFAS data from the various wastewater treatment sites is that there are significantly higher concentrations for some chemicals in the effluent than what is found in the influent. This poses the question of whether some treatment processes promote the formation and concentration of PFAS, or that some of the processes themselves contain PFAS that leach into the final drinking water effluent.
