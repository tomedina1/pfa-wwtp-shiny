### PFAS Formation in Wastewater Treatment

A major finding in the analysis of the PFAS data from the various wastewater treatment sites is that there are significantly higher concentrations for some chemicals in the effluent than what is found in the influent. This poses the question of whether some treatment processes promote the formation and concentration of PFAS, or that some of the processes themselves contain PFAS that leach into the final drinking water effluent. Further studies on PFAS formation are needed to located the source, as well as to develop a novel process that will remove these chemicals from the final effluent. Select a wastewater treatment plant and sampling date to view PFAS formation in different sites.
