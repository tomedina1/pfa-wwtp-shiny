The state of California issued [ORDER WQ 2020-0015-DWQ](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/water_quality/2020/wqo2020_0015_dwq.pdf), which requires publicly owned treatment sites with dry weather flows greater than 1 million gallons per day (1 MGD) to test for PFAS in the influent, effluent, and biosolids portions of the treatment process. Data for all of the treatment plants under this order is available at the [PFAS Geotracker Map](https://geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/map/pfas_map).
